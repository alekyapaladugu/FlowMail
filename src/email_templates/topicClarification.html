<p> Dear Professor <span id="professor-name"></span>,</p>
<br>
<p> I am in your <span id="course-no"></span>
  course. I am reaching out to seek clarification on <span id="topic"></span>.
</p>
<p>
  I have reviewed the lecture notes/consulted the textbook, but I am still unclear about <span id="topic-question"></span>.</p>
<p>
  Could you please provide further explanation or guidance on this matter?
