<p> Dear Professor <span id="professor-name"></span>,</p>
<br>
<p> I am in your <span id="course-no"></span>
  course. I am writing to inform you that I will be submitting my <span id="assignment-name"></span>
  late. I would like to request an extension until <span id="extension-date"></span>.</p>
<p>
  I would like to extend it because <span id="extension-reason"></span> &nbsp; I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and appreciate your
  understanding.
</p>
<br><br>
<p> Thank you,
  <br>
